# RaspPiPacketMachineLearning
Code for my Computer Science Challenges project

## Greetings
Hello, thank you for checking out my project! I had a great time creating it and I hope I have made things as easy for you to navigate,read and use the stuff I have made.

## Contents

### Analytics
In the Analytics folder you will find code which creates a Protocol Frequency Bar Chart. You will also find an example of the Bar Chart. I used this as a training exercise when learning PyShark. I made a video on my youtube channel explaning how to use this library: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3X4IAZVlA&t=523s

### DecisionTreeCode
In the DecisionTreeCode you will find the DDOS,machine learning code advertised in the reddit post, aswell as an accomping word document guide on how to use it. If reading is not your thing, I have also created a the guide in video form: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VqTpga0_j4&t=1s

### Docs
In the Docs folder you will find multiple word documents. These "Diaries" are apart of the module and were updated throughout.
* Comp Sci Challenge Diary
  * Updated Daily, this document details the ups and downs of the development of this project.
* Weekly Learning Log
  * Updated Weekly, this document contains a bullet point list of what commands,libraries,concepts I had learnt that week.
* Weekly Planning Diary
  * Updated Weekly, this document contains my plans for the project. They may seem too ambitious but we shall see what happens!
* Blog Post
  * For part of the module I had to create a Blog Post for QLab. I like to write the contents in a Word Doc first. Essentialy this is a Word Document form of the final Blog Post.
There is also the relevent HTML and CSS files for the website in the "Comp Sci Challenges Blog" folder.

### Flask
In the flask folder you will find an "app.py" file and a RaspPiParameter.txt file. The app.py file contains flask server code which I ran on the raspberry pi, to allow for quick file sharing from the raspberry pi to the laptop. In this way, continous mointering could be achieved. The Parameter is what is typed into the console run the python file on the raspberry pi.

### NPCAP
In this folder you will find C/C++ code relating to the architecture NPCAP. This is what I initialy thought about using for packet sniffing on the raspberry pi, however it is incompatable. This code is part of a how-to guide for the architecture as a good tutorial for it has not been created.

### Testimonial
In this folder you will find a word document containing my overall opinions on the module aswell as what I have learnt.
