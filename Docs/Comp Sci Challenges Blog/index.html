    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    At Queens University Belfast there is a module called &ldquo;Computer Science
    Challenges&rdquo; which I am enrolled on. This module sets Year 1 students a
    momentous computing task for their experience level and then sees how far
    we get along. The main goal is not to complete the task but to create
    things of value which will be useful to people.
</p>
<p>
    My task was:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Create <strong>a raspberry pi, npcap and wireshark</strong> based<strong>packet sniffing network monitor</strong> that can be attached to<strong>wired and wireless networks</strong> and    <strong>passively monitor network communications</strong>. Time permitting
    explore how anomalous transmissions can be detected using machine learning
    based modelling of normal network behaviour. This project also requires an
    analysis of the data protection and privacy implications of the
    technology.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I will detail how I went about my project and the steps involved, so that if you wish to continue it, you can.
</p>
<h1>
    QEMU &amp; Linux
</h1>
<p>
    This task intimidated me. I mean what would your response be to a paragraph
    in which you don&apos;t know what half the words mean! Anyway, the first step I
    took to tackle this problem was to dual boot Linux onto my laptop. Why?,
    Well I knew from my (very limited) experience of using a raspberry pi is
    that they are very slow. An emulator would be much easier to work with.
    Enter <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>.
    QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer, perfect
    for emulating a raspberry pi. Now granted QEMU can be run on a Windows
    operating system however there is performance loss running on Windows. I
    manage to install the Raspbian onto the QEMU, learning a variety of useful
    Linux commands. I had not used Linux before so I found this very rewarding
    to get working. Now on my machine the emulator still ran very slowly. This
    is because raspberry pis run on an ARM processor whilst my machine ran on
    an Intel x86. This difference in instruction sets meant that the
    instructions themselves needed to be translated from Intel x86 to ARM. You
    could imagine that the amount of instructions needed at one time would be
    quite high, so most processing resources were spent on this conversion. The
    work setting up this emulator was all for nothing upon the discovery of
    what NPCap was&hellip;
</p>
<h1>
    NPCap
</h1>
<p>
Npcap is the Nmap Project's packet sniffing (and sending) library for    <strong>Windows</strong>. It is based on the discontinued WinPcap library,
    but with improved speed, portability, security, and efficiency. NPCap is
    dependent on the Windows operating system, thus I couldn&apos;t run it on my
    raspberry pi, let alone my Linux emulated raspberry pi. I did some digging
    (
    <a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/1590">
        https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/1590
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=143622)">
        https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=143622)
    </a>
    ) which reaffirmed that I could not use that package. This vexed me
    massively, as learning how to use NPCap took a long time, as someone who
    has not done c programming before. I even created a how-to guide for it, in
    order to help new users (INSERT LINK TO HOW-TO GUIDE HERE).
</p>
<h1>
    TShark
</h1>
<p>
    What was I to do? With no packet sniffing package, how was I to progress?
    After much deliberation I decided to use tshark instead. Tshark is the
    terminal version of Wireshark, so it adhered to the project spec. It also
    works on most operating systems, including Raspbian.
</p>
<p>
    I found using tshark to be a very enjoyable experience. After getting use
    to the syntax, I found myself reading and writing packet files from both
    wired and wireless networks. Since the GUI version, Wireshark, is much more
    popular than the terminal based version, there was limited learning
    resources. I created a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvKiyHCRXrU&amp;t=3s">
        video tutorial
    </a>
    giving an overview of how tshark
    works
    ). You may ask why I would use tshark over Wireshark for this project. The
    answer is that Wireshark, being GUI based requires a lot more computing
    resources than tshark.
</p>
<h1>
    Setting Up Raspberry Pi
</h1>
<p>
At this stage I assembled my raspberry pi. As this device was for    <strong>wired </strong>and <strong>wireless</strong> networks, I was
    provided with a usb wireless adapter which allowed the raspberry pi to
    connect to the internet.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a list of what peripherals I used:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Raspberry Pi 3 (Running Raspbian 4.19 Buster)
  </li>
    <li>
        Monitor
    </li>
    <li>
        Mouse
    </li>
    <li>
        Keyboard
    </li>
    <li>
        Wi-Fi Adapter
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Computing resources are scare on a raspberry pi, so any saving you can
    accrue is for the best.

<p>
    Now with the packet files being produced, I now needed a way to send them
    to my laptop in an efficient manner.
</p>
<h1>
    File Sending
</h1>
<p>
    I tried to use WinSCP to send files to and from my raspberry pi. WinSCP is
    a free SFTP,SCP,S3 and FTP client application. After watching a tutorial on
    the subject, I managed to link my laptop and the raspberry pi with an SSH
connection using the wireless network. I was now able to    <strong>manually</strong> send files to and from my laptop and the
raspberry pi. This was good start, however I needed to    <strong>automatically</strong> send the files between the two machines.
    This would involve setting up an SFTP server. I looked feverously for a
    good tutorial on the subject matter, but unfortunately, I could not find
    one. That process took about 2 days, due to the constant trying and
    restarting of different methods. Eventually I gave up on this particular
    approach and decided to do use something else&hellip;
</p>
<p>
    Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is used to build
    simple websites and act as a webserver. How could this package be of use in
    this situation? I set up a webserver using Flask, which allowed me to then
    setup a URL which would, when visited, would automatically download a
    selected file. I ran this flask server on my raspberry pi and set the
    desired file to be a packet file. It worked perfectlyâ€¦ after a few
    iterations of the initialisation command. I was over the moon that I had
    found a solution to this problem as now I would be able to have a constant
    stream of packet files being sent to my laptop for processing.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In order to receive the file, I had to use another library, Pycurl, which
    is a Libcurl wrapper for python. The way it works is that Pycrul receives
    the file as a byte string. Pycrul then writes this byte string as a file
    with the specified extension.

<h1>
    Processing (Cleaning) Data
</h1>
<p>
    Speaking of processing, this is what I moved onto next. My goal at this
    stage was to do a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; for my machine learning model as I had
    no prior experience with machine learning and wanted something relatively
    simple to start. I decided that my machine learning model would determine
    if a packet was part of a DDOS or not. PyShark is a python wrapper for
    tshark. This is how I &ldquo;read&rdquo; my .pcap files into my program. I was very
    impressed by PyShark&apos;s capabilities. I made a <a> beginner's guide<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3X4IAZVlA"></a> to help ease the difficulty curve of using the library.
</p>
<p>
    In order to learn the basics of machine learning, I watched a couple of 
    <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> lectures
    for their &ldquo;Machine Learning for Coders&rdquo; course. These lectures were great
    as they immediately told me how to implement a machine learning algorithm.
    Note that in the lectures they use a RandomForestRegressor but for my
    problem I needed a RandomForestClassifier. This is because I wanted to
    classify my packets into DDOS packets or normal packets.
</p>
<p>
    Cleaning the data for this project proved quite tricky. In the fast.ai
    lectures it is made explicitly clear that all data must be in numerical
    form for the random forest to work. This means that data such as IP
    Addresses need to be treated as categories and assigned their own
    corresponding code. Also, certain protocols such as ICMP do not have port
    addresses so accounting for these protocols was also something to look out
    for.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Fast.ai recommends using pandas, which is a high-level data manipulation
    package for python, to manipulate data. This package, though extremely
    useful, did have some syntax and commands which were not very intuitive.
    Still I managed to clean the data for use in the model.
</p>
<h1>
    Datasets
</h1>
<p>
    In order to train and test my model I had to source a few datasets for my
    project. This took a while as there are not many publicily available
    datasets of useful packet data files. Here is the list of useful datasets I
    found:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Netresec is an independent
    software vendor with focus on the network security field. They also
    maintain a <a href=https://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles>dataset of pcap files</a>, some of which come from honey pots.
  <li>

<p>
    <a
        href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404814000923"
    >
        The paper &ldquo;An empirical comparison of botnet detection methods&rdquo;
    </a>
<p>
    hits a lot of the same themes that my project has.
</p>
<p>
    The scholars in this paper created their own
    <a href=https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13>public dataset</a>.
</p>
    <li>
        University of New Brunswick has many different
        <a href="https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html">
            pcap datasets
        </a>
    </li>
<p>
  I went about finding these datasets by browsing the top academic papers in the subject on Google Scholars. I also searched online via Google to see if any companies or universities had released public datasets.
</p>
<h1>
    Current Status &amp; Possible Improvements
</h1>
<p>
    I am now currently debugging the prediction method for my model. Once this
    is complete, I can test my model.
</p>
<p>
    This project could be expanded and improved in many different ways:
</p>
<ul>
  

    <li>Expanding the threat detection aspect of the model, so that it can detect
    more than just DDOS attacks.</li>

    <li>Trying different machine learning algorithms other than Random Forests</li>


    <li>Expand the project to give diagnostic information to help solve the
    problem/threat detected.</li>


    <li>Expand the project so that the device can disconnect the problem computer
    from the network.</li>
</ul>
