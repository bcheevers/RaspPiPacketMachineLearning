    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    At Queens University Belfast there is a module called &ldquo;Computer Science
    Challenges&rdquo; which I am enrolled on. This module sets Year 1 students a
    momentous computing task for their experience level and then sees how far
    we get along. The main goal is not to complete the task but to create
    things of value which will be useful to people.
</p>
<p>
    My task was:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Create <strong>a raspberry pi, npcap and wireshark</strong> based<strong>packet sniffing network monitor</strong> that can be attached to<strong>wired and wireless networks</strong> and    <strong>passively monitor network communications</strong>. Time permitting
    explore how anomalous transmissions can be detected using machine learning
    based modelling of normal network behaviour. This project also requires an
    analysis of the data protection and privacy implications of the
    technology.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I will detail how I went about my project and the steps involved, so that if you wish to continue it, you can.
</p>
<h1>
    QEMU &amp; Linux
</h1>
<p>
    This task intimidated me. I mean what would your response be to a paragraph
    in which you don&apos;t know what half the words mean! Anyway, the first step I
    took to tackle this problem was to dual boot Linux onto my laptop. Why?,
    Well I knew from my (very limited) experience of using a raspberry pi is
    that they are very slow. An emulator would be much easier to work with.
    Enter <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>.
    QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer, perfect
    for emulating a raspberry pi. Now granted QEMU can be run on a Windows
    operating system however there is performance loss running on Windows. I
    manage to install the Raspbian onto the QEMU, learning a variety of useful
    Linux commands. I had not used Linux before so I found this very rewarding
    to get working. Now on my machine the emulator still ran very slowly. This
    is because raspberry pis run on an ARM processor whilst my machine ran on
    an Intel x86. This difference in instruction sets meant that the
    instructions themselves needed to be translated from Intel x86 to ARM. You
    could imagine that the amount of instructions needed at one time would be
    quite high, so most processing resources were spent on this conversion. The
    work setting up this emulator was all for nothing upon the discovery of
    what NPCap was&hellip;
</p>
<h1>
    NPCap
</h1>
<p>
Npcap is the Nmap Project&apos;s packet sniffing (and sending) library for    <strong>Windows</strong>. It is based on the discontinued WinPcap library,
    but with improved speed, portability, security, and efficiency. NPCap is
    dependent on the Windows operating system, thus I couldn&apos;t run it on my
    raspberry pi, let alone my Linux emulated raspberry pi. I did some digging
    (
    <a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/1590">
        https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/1590
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=143622)">
        https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=143622)
    </a>
    ) which reaffirmed that I could not use that package. This vexed me
    massively, as learning how to use NPCap took a long time, as someone who
    has not done c programming before. I even created a how-to guide for it, in
    order to help new users (INSERT LINK TO HOW-TO GUIDE HERE).
</p>
<h1>
    TShark
</h1>
<p>
    What was I to do? With no packet sniffing package, how was I to progress?
    After much deliberation I decided to use tshark instead. Tshark is the
    terminal version of Wireshark, so it adhered to the project spec. It also
    works on most operating systems, including Raspbian.
</p>
<p>
    I found using tshark to be a very enjoyable experience. After getting use
    to the syntax, I found myself reading and writing packet files from both
    wired and wireless networks. Since the GUI version, Wireshark, is much more
    popular than the terminal based version, there was limited learning
    resources. I created a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvKiyHCRXrU&amp;t=3s">
        video tutorial
    </a>
    giving an overview of how tshark
    works
    ). You may ask why I would use tshark over Wireshark for this project. The
    answer is that Wireshark, being GUI based requires a lot more computing
    resources than tshark.
</p>
<h1>
    Setting Up Raspberry Pi
</h1>
<p>
At this stage I assembled my raspberry pi. As this device was for    <strong>wired </strong>and <strong>wireless</strong> networks, I was
    provided with a usb wireless adapter which allowed the raspberry pi to
    connect to the internet.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a list of what peripherals I used:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Raspberry Pi 3 (Running Raspbian 4.19 Buster)
  </li>
    <li>
        Monitor
    </li>
    <li>
        Mouse
    </li>
    <li>
        Keyboard
    </li>
    <li>
        Wi-Fi Adapter
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Computing resources are scare on a raspberry pi, so any saving you can
    accrue is for the best.

<p>
    Now with the packet files being produced, I now needed a way to send them
    to my laptop in an efficient manner.
</p>
<h1>
    File Sending
</h1>
<p>
    I tried to use WinSCP to send files to and from my raspberry pi. WinSCP is
    a free SFTP,SCP,S3 and FTP client application. After watching a tutorial on
    the subject, I managed to link my laptop and the raspberry pi with an SSH
connection using the wireless network. I was now able to    <strong>manually</strong> send files to and from my laptop and the
raspberry pi. This was good start, however I needed to    <strong>automatically</strong> send the files between the two machines.
    This would involve setting up an SFTP server. I looked feverously for a
    good tutorial on the subject matter, but unfortunately, I could not find
    one. That process took about 2 days, due to the constant trying and
    restarting of different methods. Eventually I gave up on this particular
    approach and decided to do use something else&hellip;
</p>
<p>
    Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is used to build
    simple websites and act as a webserver. How could this package be of use in
    this situation? I set up a webserver using Flask, which allowed me to then
    setup a URL which would, when visited, would automatically download a
    selected file. I ran this flask server on my raspberry pi and set the
    desired file to be a packet file. It worked perfectlyâ€¦ after a few
    iterations of the initialisation command. I was over the moon that I had
    found a solution to this problem as now I would be able to have a constant
    stream of packet files being sent to my laptop for processing.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In order to receive the file, I had to use another library, Pycurl, which
    is a Libcurl wrapper for python. The way it works is that Pycrul receives
    the file as a byte string. Pycrul then writes this byte string as a file
    with the specified extension.

<h1>
    Processing (Cleaning) Data
</h1>
<p>
    Speaking of processing, this is what I moved onto next. My goal at this
    stage was to do a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; for my machine learning model as I had
    no prior experience with machine learning and wanted something relatively
    simple to start. I decided that my machine learning model would determine
    if a packet was part of a DDOS or not. PyShark is a python wrapper for
    tshark. This is how I &ldquo;read&rdquo; my .pcap files into my program. I was very
    impressed by PyShark&apos;s capabilities. I made a <a> beginner&apos;s guide<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3X4IAZVlA"></a> to help ease the difficulty curve of using the library.
</p>
<p>
    In order to learn the basics of machine learning, I watched a couple of 
    <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> lectures
    for their &ldquo;Machine Learning for Coders&rdquo; course. These lectures were great
    as they immediately told me how to implement a machine learning algorithm.
    Note that in the lectures they use a RandomForestRegressor but for my
    problem I needed a RandomForestClassifier. This is because I wanted to
    classify my packets into DDOS packets or normal packets.
</p>
<p>
    Cleaning the data for this project proved quite tricky. In the fast.ai
    lectures it is made explicitly clear that all data must be in numerical
    form for the random forest to work. This means that data such as IP
    Addresses need to be treated as categories and assigned their own
    corresponding code. Also, certain protocols such as ICMP do not have port
    addresses so accounting for these protocols was also something to look out
    for.

</p>
<p>
    Fast.ai recommends using pandas, which is a high-level data manipulation
    package for python, to manipulate data. This package, though extremely
    useful, did have some syntax and commands which were not very intuitive.
    Still I managed to clean the data for use in the model.
</p>
<h1>
    Datasets
</h1>
<p>
    In order to train and test my model I had to source a few datasets for my
    project. This took a while as there are not many publicily available
    datasets of useful packet data files. Here is the list of useful datasets I
    found:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Netresec is an independent
    software vendor with focus on the network security field. They also
    maintain a <a href=https://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles>dataset of pcap files</a>, some of which come from honey pots.
  <li>

<p>
    <a
        href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404814000923"
    >
        The paper &ldquo;An empirical comparison of botnet detection methods&rdquo;
    </a>
<p>
    hits a lot of the same themes that my project has.
</p>
<p>
    The scholars in this paper created their own
    <a href=https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13>public dataset</a>.
</p>
    <li>
        University of New Brunswick has many different
        <a href="https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html">
            pcap datasets
        </a>
    </li>
<p>
  I went about finding these datasets by browsing the top academic papers in the subject on Google Scholars. I also searched online via Google to see if any companies or universities had released public datasets.
</p>
<h1>
    Debugging the Machine Learning.
</h1>
<p>
    When I had created my first model, the accuracy score was only 0.25. This
    meant that the model was worse at predicting DDOS packets than randomly
    guessing. This was very confusing as, on the outside, the code looked
    correct. I began debugging by checking that the data had been processed
    correctly. I found no issue with this. I then checked the accuracy metric
    itself to see if it was being calculated incorrectly. That was also
    correct. So that left only one place the error could be, the model itself.
</p>

<p>
    I began by downloading and installing Graphiz, which is the program used to
    visualise the internals of the machine learning model. I was using 100
    RandomTrees in the model, which meant that 100 tree diagrams where produce.
    Here are two of them:
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="602"
        height="339"
        src="images/Forest1.png"
        align="left"
        hspace="12"
    />
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="602"
        height="339"
        src="images/Forest2.png"
        align="left"
        hspace="12"
    />
</p>
<p>
    In the first tree diagram lies the cause for the poor accuracy rating. The
    RandomForest was using the Timestamp as a feature and had essentially
    learnt that DDOS attacks occur at certain times and if a packet is not sent
    at this time then it is not a DDOS packet. Of course, this assumption is
    incorrect. Finding this issue took a while, and so did finding the
    solution. I removed the Timestamp feature from the model, as the time the
    packet was sent has no bearing on whether it is a DDOS packet. I then
    changed the model from a RandomForestClassifier to a
    DecisionTreeClassifier. The reason for this change was that this model
    would be easier to debug (as there is only 1 tree as apposed to 100) and
    would provide greater clarity on why which packets are being classified
    into the two groups. Here is the Graphiz diagram for the
    DecisionTreeClassifier:
</p>
<p>
      <img
        width="566"
        height="555"
        src="images/DTree.png"
        align="left"
        hspace="12"
    />
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  It felt very rewarding to have resolved this issue as I gained a greater insight into how these types of machine learning algorithms work. This change increased the accuracy from 0.25 to 0.75, which is quite the improvement.
</p>
<h1>
    Current Status &amp; Possible Improvements
</h1>
<p>
    This project could be expanded and improved in many different ways:
</p>
<ul>
  

    <li>Expanding the threat detection aspect of the model, so that it can detect
    more than just DDOS attacks.</li>

    <li>Trying different machine learning algorithms other than Random Forests</li>


    <li>Expand the project to give diagnostic information to help solve the
    problem/threat detected.</li>


    <li>Expand the project so that the device can disconnect the problem computer
    from the network.</li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Testing &amp; Analysis System
</h1>
<p>
    Below I have outlined all the possible things I can think of that may go
    wrong with the project, in a systematic approach.

<p>
    Ideally, I would like to be able to numerically measure each point in the
    testing process i.e. to what extent the problem is solved. In the sections
    below the first paragraph will detail how I would approach solving the
    specific problem, the second will be an attempt to numerically measure the
    extent to which the problem is solved.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>System can handle large packet files</h2>
</p>
<p>
    I would have to test if the system can handle extremely large packet files
    (i.e. the datasets) and still produce correct results. Unfortunately, my
    laptop is simply not up to the task, so I would need a computer with more
    computational resources or an externally rented server. The system will
    still work if I cannot run the large datasets past it, thus it is
    categorised as &quotMedium&quot for severity.
</p>
<p>
    To design a numeric test for this, we could create &quotlevels&quot. Each level
    would have a file associated with it and the size of the file increases by
    ten times the previous levels file size. This way one can assign a &quotlevel&quot
    to the system based on the highest level achieved without breaking.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>System doesn&apos;t detect the latest network attacks</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Using the latest DDOS attacks to attack a device and record the packet
    files from that attack is how I would test if the system can detect the
    latest network attacks. Kali Linux seems to be a good source for these
    types of attacks. More specifically I would use Slowloris, as it uses
    partial HTTP requests, which may prove challenging if the partial HTTP
    packets are corrupted and thus perhaps not picked up by tshark. Another
    attack which could be used to test the system would be HOIC (High Orbit Ion
    Canon), as it uses a mixture HTTP, GET and POST requests. This mix of
    packet protocols may confuse the system and result in a false negative. I&aposm
    unsure of how hard it would be to use Kali Linux, but with enough time I&aposm
    sure I could do it. If the system managed to pass these tests without
    alteration, I would be very impressed.
</p>
<p>
    After garnering the latest network threats, I could create a test for the
    system, with a numeric score at the end, which would involve the system
    being tested against these new threats. Of course, these threats would be
    on a secure private network, as to not affect other people. The challenge
    here will be obtaining these latest network threats, as those who possess
    them may not provide them.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>
        The system can&apos;t detect &quotniche&quot network attacks which do not have a lot
        of data about them.
    </h2>
</p>
<p>
    A big concern for me is having a niche/atypical attack get through the
    system undetected. The trouble with these types of attacks is that there is
    very little data on them (due to being niche) and so there is scant
    information to train the system on. To combat this there are two options.
    Either I could write a web scraper that would scour the internet for every
    scrap of information on these niche attacks or I could simply let the
    attack pass through but flag it. Once flagged, the attack can simply be
    inspected, and then specific rules added to the system in order to prevent
    the attack from passing in again. The second option does not use the
    machine learning aspect of the project but might be the best option in
    these sorts of situation, one in which you have very limited information.
</p>
<p>
    To tackle this problem, I may need to build a separate model which detects
    anomalies in network traffic. Anomaly detection is essentially a model
    which learns what normal traffic looks like, and when it detects a
    deviation from the normal, it alerts. The resulting alert would not lead to
    a network shutdown, ( as deviations from normal network traffic are more
    common and less severe then attempted network attacks), but would instead
    prompt a network manager to investigate. This solves the issue of not
    having any training data for niche attacks.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>The system isn&apos;t dynamic and can&apos;t update itself.</h2>
</p>
<p>
    The nature of network attacks means that they are constantly changing.
    Attackers create new attacks to get over pre-existing defences. As a
    result, there is a need for the system to be dynamic. This dynamic nature
    is provided by the machine learning algorithm. However, this dynamic nature
    can only be continued if there is a constant stream of new information on
    the latest attacks. Therefore, I would need to link the system to
    Metasploit. Metasploit is the world&apos;s most used penetration testing
    framework and is open sourced. This global repository for all network
    attacks is too valuable to pass up.
</p>
<p>
    Updating the rules for the system essentially means sending a file to the
    system remotely. This is a simple true or false, does the file arrive or
    doesn&apost it? I think the issue comes whenever there are multiple systems in
    place, which all need updating.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Raspberry Pi overheating.</h2>
</p>
<p>
    I am by no means an electrician; however, I do know that standard raspberry
    pis do not have much in terms of computational resources. The raspberry pi
    is already set up in command line mode, so it has no desktop GUI to
    maintain. Still I do worry about the pi overheating or breaking due to the
    number of complex processes it must carry out. It may be necessary to
    modify the raspberry pi. I have these suggestions; upgrade the CPU, replace
    the heatsink and change the case to prevent overheating. I think the
    current version of my raspberry pi is fine, and the software can be easily
    moved to a raspberry pi 4, so perhaps customising the raspberry pi is
    excessive.
</p>
<p>
    I&aposm not sure on how to numerically measure overheating. I suppose taking
    the systems temperature throughout operation is probably the best option.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>False Positives</h2>
</p>
<p>
    A false positive would not be good for the system&aposs credibility. Due to
    this project using machine learning, I would imagine a few false positives
    occurring initially. This is because the datasets the algorithm has trained
    on may be skewed. The longer the system operates, the &quotsmarter&quot it gets,
    thus the likelihood of a false positive decreases. In conclusion there
    isn&apos;t much I can do to prevent these false positives. This might be a na&Iuml;ve
    approach.The
    incorporation of a logging system could be useful, as it would tell us
    exactly why a false positive occurred.
</p>
<p>
    False positives will most likely have to be monitored by the user. If a
    false positive does occur, the user could send the log file to me. It may
    be the case that I would have to add explicit rules to the system in order
    to avoid these false positives.
</p>
<p>
    Another approach for tackling False Positives is by having the model create
    confidence values for each of its classifications,(it already does his
    internally, this value is called the gini value). Currently the system
    values equally a non-DDOS packet and a normal packet. We could alter the
    confidence threshold for a DDOS packet so that the system would have to be
    85%(or other value) certain that the packet is a DDOS packet and to trigger
    a response.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Disconnected from Network</h2>
</p>
<p>
    If the system is disconnected from the network, a contingency plan would
    need to be put in place. This plan could either consist of the system
    triggering the alarm (as a malicious person could have disconnected the
    system purposefully), or the system could remain in a &quotsuspended state&quot and
    will stay in that state until it is reconnected to the network. In either
    case I don&apos;t think that this would be too difficult to implement and adds
    more security and reliability to the system. The log would need to readily
    available to its users, so perhaps an external display is required.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    This is a simple test, either the system performs the desired response when
    it is disconnected, or it does not. This does not need to be in a numeric
    form.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Dealing with Corrupted Packets</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Corrupted packets are a fact of life when it comes to network
    communication. Sometimes these packets are just dropped by the devices that
    receive them, other times they are re transmitted. An enquiry will have to
    be done on how frequently corrupt packets affect the system. There may be
    no need to consider this problem, since those packets are simply dropped.
    If this is not the case however the system already accounts for packets
    with missing data (the _na collumns) so the system will not crash.
</p>
<p>
    A test composing of packet files containing corrupted packets can be
    devised. To test the systems response to corrupted packets, the system can
    read each packet file sequentially. We can then assign a &quotscore&quot to the
    system based on its response to these packets.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Physical Attack on the System</h2>
</p>
<p>
    An attacker could physically break the raspberry pi, rendering the system
    useless and thus allowing attacks to go through unnoticed. I&apos;m not worried
    about this though as once all necessary modifications have been completed
    and the device is ready to be used by everyone, we can mould a stainless
    steel case for the system, thus making it nearly impossible for an attacker
    to break the system.
</p>
<p>
    A stress test could be created using a piston which will exert pressure
    onto the case of the system. The value of the force required to break the
    case will be recorded. Using this data, we could then further improve the
    case. It would be worth orientating the case a different way each time as
    this would ensure a level of security on all sides of the case.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>75% Accuracy Rating</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Right now, the machine learning algorithm obtains a 75% accuracy rate. This
    accuracy value, while good, is not the best it could be. To increase
    accuracy using just one dataset is leads to overfitting however so I must
    be very careful about how I go about this.
</p>
<p>
    To solve this, I suggest further refinement of the features, so that only
    the most impactful features are kept. This would mean that non impactful
    features could be removed and so that would inherently increase accuracy,
    as the model would not be led astray. Then further testing would be done on
    a wider variety of datasets.
</p>
<p>
    The numeric results at the end of testing could be used to grade the system
    overall. This numerical result would be useful if the system was to be mass
    produced.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of Analysis, I can already visualize the Decision tree algorithm
    using Graphvis. It might be useful to create a series of matplot lib graphs
    akin to the one below:
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="602"
        height="451"
        src="images/Bar.png"
        align="left"
        hspace="12"
    />
</p>
<p>
    I&apos;m not sure what metrics these graphs will track/record, but the more data
    about the packet files being inputted into the system means that the system
    will be easier to debug in the future.
</p>
<p>
    <h1>User Analysis</h1>
</p>
<p>
    Another analysis which needs to occur is user analysis. This will allow me
    to gain insights into how users seem to be using my project. This knowledge
    would then allow me to steer the project into a direction that the user
    base would want. Different metrics can be measured in order to achieve
    this. A simple questionnaire could appear to the user, asking for their
    feedback. Whilst this may seem intrusive, it could prove useful as it opens
    a dialogue between creator and user. I have made an example of this
    questionnaire using Google Forms, again I tried to make it brief, as no one
    likes filling out tireless forms:

    Another metric I could use is identifying what types of attacks are being
    detected the most. With this knowledge I can sure up the defences for that
    attack, and perhaps remove old or out of date attack data, as this would
    reduce the file size of the project. Another metric could be scanning a
    user&apos;s network to determine what types of devices are connected to it. With
    this information, the system could be tailored to defending specific
    network devices e.g. routers, hubs etc. However, this may prove to be too
    intrusive. If the user signed an agreement with me for this data, then this
    wouldn&apos;t be a problem.

  This was a really interesting project to work on, and I am grateful for having the opportunity to pursue it. Special thanks to QLab for providing hardware resources.
